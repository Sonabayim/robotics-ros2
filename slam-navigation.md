After setting up ros2, gazebo and rviz. It's time to map the environment of the robot. For that we need to run the gazebo launch command in terminal (dont forget to source the respective environments), open separate terminal and launch teleop command to control the robot using keyboard. Take into account each new terminal you open you have to source your environment accordingly.
